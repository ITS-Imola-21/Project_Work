## Bypass Firewall Watchguard

In this Graphic, it is graphically depicted how we did to bypass the school firewall "Watchguard "to reach the Internet.
A smartphone, connected to the main Gateway, authenticated on the firewall, was used to act as a "bridging" device.
By doing so, all devices connected to the other network interface of the smartphone, the one used to run the hotspot, would cascade "free" to reach the main gateway without being blocked by the firewall.
This allowed us that all packets leaving our Echo Dot were free to leave the school's private network, avoiding being preemptively blocked by the firewall.
